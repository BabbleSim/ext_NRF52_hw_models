 * HW Interrupt Controller model
 *
 * Note: In principle this should have been a model of the ARM NVIC
 *  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.100166_0001_00_en/ric1417175922867.html
 *
 * But so far it is just a general INT controller that provides
 * a reasonable emulation of the NVIC functionality used in Zephyr
 *
 * Implementation spec:
 *   This file provides the implementation of a generic interrupt controller,
 *   and instantiates N of them (and initializes them at startup),
 *   as described in the configuration (NHW_config.h).
 *
 *   This interrupt controller must be paired with dedicated interrupt handling
 *   code.
 *
 *   Each interrupt has a configurable priority (256 levels).
 *   Interrupts can be individually masked, apart from interrupts globally locked.
 *   With the appropriate interrupt handling code, interrupt nesting is supported.
 *
 *   The interrupt controller supports both level and edge/pulse interrupts.
 *   The level interrupts "lines" must be raised and *lowered* by the peripherals.
 *   ( hw_irq_ctrl_{raise|lower}_level_irq_line() )
 *   Pulse/edge interrupts are just events that pend the interrupt
 *   (calls to hw_irq_ctrl_set_irq()).
 *
 *   NOTE: At this point an interrupt controller may have at most 64 interrupt lines.
 *   Generalizing this is pending.
