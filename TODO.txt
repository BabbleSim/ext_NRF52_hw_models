Current limitations and pending things to do:
(T): To do
(N): Nice to have
(L): Low priority
(VL): Very low priority (not used in current controller SW)

* Proper testing: All currently implemented models have only been tested lightly

* RADIO:
	* (L) Only BLE packet format supported (no LR)
	* (L) Only default freq. map supported
	* (VL) Only 1st logical address is supported
	* (VL) More limitation listed in NRF_RADIO.c
* ECB:
* AAR:
* AES-CCM:
* FICR:
	* Just empty registers by now
	* (N) Would be nice to have a programmable BT-Addr from command line
* RNG:
	* (N) Delay is always the same and constant (with or without bias correction)
* TIMER:
	* (VL) Counter mode is not fully supported

Not implemented, and no plans to implement:
* WDT, QDEC, LPCOMP, COMP, PWM, PDM, ACL, NVMC, MWU, SPIM/S, I2S, FPU, USB, 
  UART, QSPI, GPIO, CRYPTOCELL, UICR
